---

## 📞 Support & Debugging

### Common Issues & Fixes
1. **Backend won't start**: Check port 5000 is free
2. **Events not loading**: Run `node seed.js`
3. **Login fails**: Verify credentials in seed.js
4. **API errors**: Check backend console logs
5. **UI breaks**: Clear browser cache and reload

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/events

# List database tables
sqlite3 backend/events.db ".tables"

# Check Node processes
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Clear Node cache
npm cache clean --force
```
